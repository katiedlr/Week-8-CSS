    <h2>A glimpse of Myself</h2>
    <div><p>
        Over 15 years experience engaging directly with customers in roles in the casino, hotel, and travel/tourism industries- with consistent, high levels of interaction in fast paced environments.<br>
        Curious, open minded, motivated, lifelong learner who always maintains optimism and professionalism.<br>
        Developed and honed my interpersonal skills through my experience interacting extensively with people from all walks of life, from all over the globe- mostly from my experience as a dealer on the world-renowned Las Vegas Strip and as a Flight Attendant based in one of the busiest airports in the world<br>
        Always seeking out and embracing new challenges, self growth, and personal development.<br>
        Always looking to explore new places, eat new things, gain new experiences, and add to the more than a dozen countries I've traveled to thus far. <br>
        My favorite things in life include reading non-fiction books, getting lost in music, and soaking in the wonders of raising two inquisitive little boys.<br> 
        Enthusiastically exploring new possibilities in technology and software development.<br>
        Actively seeking opportunities to utilize the skills I've acquired from my Front End Software Development bootcamp with Promineo Tech.
